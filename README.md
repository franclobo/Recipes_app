# Recipe App

## Description

The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It allows user to save ingredients to a recipe, keep track of stock, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on the difference between inventory and recipe requirements. To allow sharing the recipe, the user or creater can indicate whether it is private or public.

    - Should display a list of food added by the logged-in user as in the wireframe (for teams with only 2 people - display also quantity of a given food).
    - Should lead to a form that allows users to add new food.
